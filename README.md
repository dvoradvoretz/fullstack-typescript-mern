# Promotions dynamic table structure App with React, TypeScript, NodeJS, and MongoDB

In this project, I will be using TypeScript on both sides (server and client) to build a Todo App from scratch with React, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.
In client side I use material-ui  for Virtualized table and more styling.
